i am learning git
git is version control system


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
i can spot bugs and revise my code easily


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
control is with me and i can logically add comments on commit


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
it's nice and keeps track of my program as a whole


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
by comparing two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
i'll get the confidence that i can go back to my previous algorithm which worked better.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
writing programs
