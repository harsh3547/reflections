Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks for copying a repo. into my space on github
clones for copying a repo from github/local to local
branches is for trying on new features or for experimenting/bug fixing---it is a different set of commits child to a commit on master


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
so that we can see changes made to it on remote branch by others and merge and resolve conflicts if any

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
separate branch-- when i have large changes to make else directly in master branch
